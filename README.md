HyperDisplay ILI9163C Arduino Library
========================================

This is a mid-level extension to [HyperDisplay](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_HyperDisplay). It provides for control of any display using the ILI9163C driver, however it doesn not provide any instantiable classes. To use this driver make sure you have [HyperDisplay](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_HyperDisplay) then derive a new class for your particular display and implement all pure-virtual functions.
